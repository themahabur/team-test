# Career Goal: GitHub Collaboration Practice Project

Welcome to Career Goal's collaboration practice space! This project is designed to help us get comfortable with the GitHub workflow we'll be using for our main project. The goal here is to practice creating branches, making commits, opening pull requests, and resolving merge conflicts.

## ðŸš€ Project Goal

The main objective of this project is simple: Each team member will add their name to the CONTRIBUTORS.md file. This will simulate the process of making individual contributions to a shared project.

## ðŸ“‹ Instructions: How to Contribute

Please follow these steps carefully to practice our collaboration workflow. Since we are all collaborators on this repository, we will not be forking.

## 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the project repository to your local machine.

```
git clone [https://github.com/themahabur/team-test.git](https://github.com/themahabur/team-test.git)
```

## 2. Create a New Branch

Before making any changes, create your own personal branch. This is a crucial step to keep our work organized. Name your branch something descriptive, like add-your-name.

```
git checkout -b add-your-name
```

## 3. Add Your Name

Now it's time to make your change!

- Create a new file named CONTRIBUTORS.md if it doesn't exist.

- Add your name to the file on a new line.

4. Commit Your Changes
   Save the file and commit your changes with a clear commit message.

```
git add CONTRIBUTORS.md
git commit -m "feat: Add [Your Name] to contributors list"
```

## 5. Push Your Branch to GitHub

Push your new branch and its commit to the shared repository on GitHub.

```
git push origin add-your-name
```

## 6. Open a Pull Request

Go to the repository on GitHub. You should see a prompt to create a Pull Request from your new branch.

- Click the "Compare & pull request" button.

- Add a title and a brief description of your changes.

- Click "Create pull request".

7. Review and Merge
   Once a pull request is opened, the team leader will review the changes and merge them into the main branch.
